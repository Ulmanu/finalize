# Overnight Autonomous Run Report

Run: autonomous execution of TODO.md (Bootstrap 00 + OpenSpec changes 01–74)
Branch: `agent/things-web-overnight`
Agent: opencode (deepseek-v4.1-flash)

## Bootstrap 00 — status: COMPLETE

- Repository inspected: empty git history, untracked planning bundle
  (`TODO.md`, `openspec/`, `.agents/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `skills-lock.json`).
- Isolated branch created: `agent/things-web-overnight` (no pre-existing user work discarded;
  `.idea/` and `.rtk/` are gitignored local state).
- Tool versions:
  - cargo 1.95.0 (Homebrew), rustc 1.95.0 (Homebrew)
  - OpenSpec CLI 1.13.1 (propose/apply/archive skills installed; **no `/opsx:verify` skill** —
    manual artifact↔implementation verification is used and recorded per change)
  - node/pnpm/npm available; `trunk`, `wasm-pack`, `cargo-leptos` NOT installed
  - Docker daemon NOT running; `psql` NOT installed → live PostgreSQL integration tests are
    conditional on `DATABASE_URL`; in-memory persistence adapter is used for deterministic tests.
  - rustup NOT installed (Homebrew toolchain) → `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target unavailable at
    bootstrap; WASM target check is attempted and its availability recorded per change.
- OpenSpec project rules installed in `openspec/config.yaml` (Rust-only source policy,
  architecture, parity/branding policy, artifact rules, apply/archive guidance).
- Parity policy frozen:
  - Observable Things-style behavior, information architecture, and interaction quality are the
    reference targets.
  - Apple-native-only integrations receive documented web equivalents.
  - Original branding: product name **Momentum**; original CSS/icon assets only. No Cultured Code
    trademarks, logos, marketing art, or proprietary icons.
- Rust-only application-source policy confirmed and recorded in `openspec/config.yaml`.
- Baseline build/test/validation: repository contained no Rust code before change 01.
  `openspec validate --specs --strict --no-interactive` on an empty spec tree reports no specs;
  there are no pre-existing failures to attribute.
- Bootstrap commit: see git log (`chore(00): bootstrap OpenSpec project and overnight report`).
